Date Fruit Recognition Project

## Overview

This project focuses on the classification of date fruits by type using deep learning techniques. We utilized a dataset obtained from Kaggle and applied TensorFlow to develop our model. The project also incorporates various Python libraries for Data Frame creation, data visualization, and visual preprocessing.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle:

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow**: For deep learning model implementation.
- **Python Libraries**:
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - Matplotlib / Seaborn: For data visualization.
  - OpenCV: For image preprocessing.
- **Streamlit**: To create a user-friendly web interface for model predictions.

## Web Interface

You can interact with the classification model through the web interface hosted on Hugging Face Spaces:
